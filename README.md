# Digital Texts in the Humanities
HIST 426 Course Website 2024 (Lancaster University)

Instructor: Katherine McDonough, Lecturer in DH, Lancaster University

## Course Summary

Despite huge advances in digital technologies, most historians use methods that predate computers. Even when using online digitised collections such as Early English Books Online or the British Newspaper Archive, many historians simply keyword search and browse, never making use of their full potential or learning to critique digitised sources. This module introduces students to technologies for digital research with historical texts and highlights how historians can use such tools and datasets effectively to make new historical arguments. 

Developing critical skills to assess and use digital text technologies is essential for historians of the future: this module prepare historians to be informed users and possibly creators of tools and data that are already re-shaping the discipline. Through a combination of hands-on tutorials, readings, and discussion, students will have opportunities not only to understand the ways that digital text technologies impact historical research, but also to learn text analysis skills themselves.

Topics may include: the history of digitisation (including OCR) and the emergence of searchable text collections; early corpus linguistics, network analysis, topic modelling, and newer statistical- and AI-driven methods; multilingual text challenges; copyright and public domain issues; current challenges in textual data creation; the relationship between text and image; textual reuse; big data.

No prior computing knowledge is required beyond what students with undergraduate degrees in History will have. Sample research data may draw on documents from French, US, and British history predominantly from the seventeenth to the twentieth century, including newspapers, books, pamphlets, census records, oral history transcripts, congressional/parliamentary speeches, maps, letters, and more. Students will also be encouraged to test and reflect on sources in their own fields.
